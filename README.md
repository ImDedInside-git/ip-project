## Synopsis

#### Objective
The objective of this project is to highlight the use cases of python and its
libraries, mainly matplotlib and NumPy by showing the distribution of
Operating Systems in the world.

#### Introduction
An operating system (OS) is a system software that, after being initially
loaded into the computer by a bootloader, manages computer hardware,
software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

#### Description
This project is prepared by a group of students from class 12-D using Google
Docs, GEISB, GNU Linux, Neovim, Python3, Visual Studio Code & Mozilla Firefox.

#### Project Analysis
With the help of the project, we aim to help you to understand the market
share of different Operating Systems in the industry. The OS market share
since its inception has seen many changes and we aim to analyze those
changes in this project.

#### Conclusion
Every Operating System has its own strengths and weaknesses.
Windows is popular because of its ease of use and the plethora of software
and games made for it. Its weaknesses are its cost, low stability, high system
requirements and built-in telemetry.
MacOS is popular among entrepreneurs and executives who favor a clean
and elegant GUI as well as some degree of stability and security.
Linux based distros are the go-to Operating Systems in the server and
supercomputer world because of its unrivaled performance and stability.
Desktop Linux with a GUI is used by Super Users who want more granular
control over their PC, which Windows does not allow.
